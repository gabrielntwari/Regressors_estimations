🔍 Linear Model Diagnostics Tools for Scikit-Learn Regression Models

This project provides a collection of statistical diagnostics tools tailored for linear regression models built using scikit-learn. It is designed to help students and practitioners better understand and interpret the outputs of their regression models beyond just R² scores and coefficients.

These utilities compute classic linear regression statistics such as:

Standardized & Studentized residuals

Adjusted R²

Coefficient standard errors

t-values and p-values

F-statistics

The goal is to bridge the gap between traditional statistical analysis (as provided by packages like statsmodels) and the machine learning workflows often used in scikit-learn.
